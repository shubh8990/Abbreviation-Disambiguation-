directly at the moment of reperfusion during ptca

studies which have mostly lumped Tc and rectal PT together in this study we investigated the diagnostic utility of immunohistochemical stains for ck ck and cdx in a series of rectal adenocarcinoma fiftyfive specimens of rectal adenocarcinomas were retrieved and immunostained for ck dakom ck novocastra ncllck and cdx novocastra nclcdx thirty cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and CC were also studied as a comparison group ck was expressed in and ck in cases of rectal adenocarcinoma the ckck immunophenotype was identified in ckck in and ckck in rectal adenocarcinoma cdx showed moderatestrong positivity in all cases and was not related to RT differentiation benign rectal mucosa was available in cases and showed the following results ckck in ckck in and ckck in cases in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas were ckck and were ckck cdx was positive in only of these cases all were pancreatic adenocarcinomas in conclusion ck can be expressed in rectal adenocarcinoma and should not be used as the sole basis for excluding a rectal primary cdx is a CS marker for rectal origin of adenocarcinoma it can be helpful in cases with metastatic rectal carcinoma especially those with ckck or ckck immunophenotype in this study cdx expression was not influenced by the grade differentiation of rectal adenocarcinoma   \n2  many healthcare facilities and other notforprofit organizations employ enough people to be covered by the new worker adjustment and retraining notification act which requires businesses to give days notice of a shutdown or mass layoffs leaders of these organizations should be aware of the laws terms the law requires that any business enterprise that employs fulltime workers give days notice of a closing or mass layoffs it also covers businesses that employ or more workers both full time and part time who work at least a total of hours per week it defines employer as any business enterprise that employs the required number of persons interim interpretive rules include NFP organizations in this definition and the final rules are not likely to change this the organization must give notice in writing to each representative of the affected employees or to each employee in addition it must notify in writing the state dislocated worker unit and the local government to which the business paid the highest taxes in the previous year notice is not required if it would prevent the organization from obtaining capital or business necessary to continue operations if the shutdown is due to NK disaster or if the shutdown was unforeseeable the law also allows exceptions for strikes lockouts and temporary jobs
